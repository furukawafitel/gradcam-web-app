## The Grad-CAM
Gradient Class Activation Maps(Grad-CAM) are a visualization technique for deep learning networks.

via Gradient-based Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391v1.pdf)

Grad-CAM visualizations of the model predictions (see the red regions in the middle column) revealed
that the model had learned to look at the personâ€™s face / hairstyle to distinguish nurses from doctors, thus learning a gender stereotype. Indeed, the model was misclassifying several female doctors to be a nurse and male nurses to be a doctor. Clearly, this is problematic. Turns out the image search results were gender-biased
